## 2. HW Transition Base Rates

> This is the key calibration step. How fast has Tesla ramped new HW before?

### HW3 → HW4 Ramp Timeline

| Milestone | Date | Source |
|---|---|---|
| First credible sighting | | |
| First customer delivery | | |
| Available on configurator (Model Y) | | |
| Available on configurator (Model 3) | | |
| Estimated >30% of deliveries | | |
| Estimated >50% of deliveries | | |

**Time from first sighting → first delivery:** *(X months)*
**Time from first delivery → 30% volume:** *(X months)*
**Time from first delivery → configurator availability:** *(X months)*

### What Analogies Hold for A15

## 7. Software Capability Forecast

### Scenario S1 (Base): Incremental Improvement

Observable proxies:
- OTA update cadence: *(current vs projected)*
- Release notes scope: *(current vs projected)*
- Community regression reports: *(trend)*
- ODD expansion: *(current boundaries vs projected)*

**Projected early-2027 capability on HW4 (no new hardware):**
*(What software alone can deliver)*

**Projected early-2027 capability on A15 (if available):**
*(What new hardware enables beyond software-only gains)*

### Scenario S2 (Optimistic): Accelerated Improvement

Same proxy structure, with more aggressive assumptions:
*(Document what's different and why)*

### What LLMs Do NOT Solve

- Sensing hardware limits (camera resolution, occlusion, rain/fog physics)
- Long-tail safety events (novel obstacles, adversarial conditions)
- Regulatory/legal speed limits on deployment
- Liability framework uncertainty
- Map/infrastructure data freshness
