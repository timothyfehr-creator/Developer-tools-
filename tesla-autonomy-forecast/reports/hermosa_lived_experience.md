## 1. Route Class Definitions

### Scoring Rubric

| Score | Intervention Rate (per trip) | Annoyance | Feel |
|---|---|---|---|
| **5** (excellent) | 0–1 minor | Rare nags, no phantoms | Relaxing; you forget you're supervising |
| **4** (good) | 1–2 minor | Occasional nag, rare phantom | Comfortable; occasional glance-checks |
| **3** (acceptable) | 2–4 minor OR 1 significant | Noticeable nags | Alert but not stressed |
| **2** (mediocre) | 4+ minor OR 2+ significant | Frequent nags/phantoms | Vigilant; hands hovering |
| **1** (poor) | Frequent significant | Constant | Stressful; why bother? |

**Definitions:**
- *Minor intervention:* Steering nudge, gentle brake to smooth out behavior, or verbal "come on" that doesn't require immediate takeover
- *Significant intervention:* Full takeover required to avoid unsafe outcome, near-miss, or major routing error

### Route Classes

| Class | Typical Trip | Distance | Key Road Types | Primary Stressors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A: Local surface** | Errands: Hermosa → Torrance, Redondo, Manhattan Beach | 5–8 mi | Residential streets, arterials (PCH, Sepulveda, Hawthorne), parking lots | Unprotected lefts, stop signs, pedestrians, bikes, delivery trucks, tight parking |
| **B: Short freeway hop** | Hermosa → El Segundo, Gardena | 5–10 mi | PCH → 405 → local exit | Short merge/exit windows (<2 mi), lane changes at speed, speed differentials |
| **C: Medium — beach cities** | Hermosa → Santa Monica | 15–20 mi | 405 N or PCH, SM surface streets | 405 congestion (Culver City crawl), SM city streets, destination parking |
| **D: Medium — downtown** | Hermosa → DTLA | 20–25 mi | 405 → 110 N, downtown grid | 110 freeway (narrow, curves, old infrastructure), DTLA grid (peds, bikes, Uber/Lyft, one-ways) |
| **E: Road trip — desert** | Hermosa → Palm Springs | ~120 mi | 405/105 → I-10 E | Long highway cruise, Cabazon wind corridor, sun glare, construction, PS resort streets |
| **F: Road trip — coastal/mountain** | Hermosa → Ojai or Central CA | 80–200 mi | 101 N, PCH, mountain roads | Two-lane roads, curves, limited passing, rural intersections, speed changes |
| **G: Road trip — I-5 corridor** | Hermosa → San Diego | ~120 mi | 405 → I-5 S | Monotonic highway, Camp Pendleton stretch, SD urban arrival, Carlsbad/Encinitas curves |

## 2. Per Route Class: Automation Assessment

### Class A: Local Surface (Hermosa errands, 5–8 mi)

**Where you'd engage FSD:**
